<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I've always had a passion for creating things. My childhood involved a lot of Legos and cardboard castles. When I turned 10 years old my family moved to Denmark and I was exposed to a new form of design: Scandinavian minimalism. I travelled occassionally to new cities across Europe and happily absorbed all of the new sensory information. I loved the classical architecture of Italy, the romantic facades of France, the stone castles of Prague, but I always found myself coming back to the careful and simplistic forms in Danish design. Today, this inspiration manifests itself on the web.

  I created this website as a fun personal project, but also a small experiment in front end development. New websites frequently place form over function and I wanted to pay homage to old school efficiency with my design. I plan on making improvements to the UI and the content while keeping it lightning fast!
  <br></br>
  I continually strive towards improvement. I develop products I believe in by iterating agilely, minimizing ruthlessly, and supporting my team wholeheartedly. If you'd like to work with me, click contact in the sidebar and reach out to me on social media or via email.
