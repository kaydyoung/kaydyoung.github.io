<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I've always had a passion for creating things. My childhood involved a lot of Legos and cardboard castles. When I turned 10 years old my family moved to Denmark and I was exposed to a new form of design: Scandinavian minimalism. I travelled occassionally to new cities across Europe and happily absorbed all of the new sensory information. I loved the classical architecture of Italy, the romantic facades of France, the stone castles of Prague, but I always found myself coming back to the careful and simplistic forms in Danish design. Today, this inspiration manifests itself on the web.

  I created this website as a fun personal project, but also a small experiment in front end development. New websites frequently place form over function and I wanted to pay homage to old school efficiency with my design. I like taking this approach to all of my products. Where can we minimize fluff and maximize customer experience? How can we iterate on designs faster while delivering greater value?
<br></br>
My first position as a product manager immersed me in the world of data science. I took a product in the early stages and created a cohesive platform for data discovery, AI/ML model development, training, deployment, and feedback. In addition to being a one stop shop for data scientists, we gave BI analysts a free space to create and share data visualizations with easy to follow tutorials I crafted. Diving into the world of data science was a difficult task. I was learning python for the first time, learning about enterprise data architecture, and becoming an expert in Jupyter notebooks, but these challenges excited me and drove me to succeed.  My passion for learning pushed me to develop this website. I studied HTML/CSS, clickstream analytics, and SEO. After I was satisfied with my design I started a blog to document everything else I'm learning and improve my written communication skills.

I continually strive towards improvement. I develop products I believe in by iterating agilely, minimizing ruthlessly, and supporting my team wholeheartedly. If you'd like to work with me, click contact in the sidebar and reach out to me on social media or via email.
