    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I help teams create products that customers love. I facilitate effective communication among stakeholders,
      manage complex requirements, and keep a detailed eye on data analytics amidst the chaos.
      <br></br>
      My obsession with solving problems has led me to different areas of study and enabled me to wear many hats when needed, including UI/UX and software development.
      My knowledge of design thinking gives me a broad perspective on user experience and my technical expertise makes me a well rounded product manager that can connect to customers, developers, and designers with ease.

    <h1>My Website</h1>
      <p>
        I've always had a passion for creating things. My childhood involved a lot of Legos and cardboard castles.
        When I was 10 years old my family moved overseas and I was immersed in new cultures and exposed to new ways of thinking.
        My experience inspires me today and manifests itself on the web.
        <br></br>
        I created this website as a fun personal project, but also as an experiment in optimizing a webpage for speed without sacrificing user experience.
        New websites frequently place form over function and I wanted to pay homage to old school efficiency and scandinavian minimalism with my design.
