      <p>
        I started working in product management in 2018.
        My interests led me to study UX design and I began developing websites in my free time.
        As I learned how users actually engage with software, I was inspired to study system design
        and architecture to make faster and better products.
        <br></br>
        I successfully implemented complex architectural changes in my role as product manager by
        deprecating old technologies and streamlining our platform. My team relied on me to provide strategic direction and my organizational skills led me to
        coordinate working sessions with the developers, plan UAT testing, design communication with customers,
        as well as present data analytics reports to leadership.
        <br></br>
        Once the migration was complete, we were able to work on improving the customer experience
        and really innovate, due to the reduction in support and maintenance overhead.
        <br></br>
        My drive to solve problems, my knowledge of design thinking, and my technical experience makes me a well rounded product manager with plenty of passion for innovation.
        <br></br>
