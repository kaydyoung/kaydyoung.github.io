      <p>I am currently working on a self service data science product at General Motors. Our application enables users to discover data, develop and train algorithms, collaborate on projects, and publish/share data visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>My first position as a product manager immersed me in the world of data science. I took a product in the early stages and created a cohesive platform for data discovery, AI/ML model development, training, deployment, and feedback. In addition to being a one stop shop for data scientists, we gave BI analysts a free space to create and share data visualizations with easy to follow tutorials I crafted. Diving into the world of data science was a difficult task. I was learning python for the first time, learning about enterprise data architecture, and becoming an expert in Jupyter notebooks, but these challenges excited me and drove me to succeed.</p>
