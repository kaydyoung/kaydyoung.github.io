    <h2>Ecommerce site to discover and support local businesses</h2><br>
<img src="/assets/images/shoplocalwindow1.png" style="height: 50vh; width: 32vw; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);"><br></br>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>
    The Small Business Finder ecommerce site enables users to discover local businesses near them and support their community while finding and purchasing what they need. There are plenty of e-commerce sites available, but what makes this unique is the value it brings to the community. Small businesses don’t have super optimized SEO algorithms to make them the top search result in Google and they are constantly beat out by cheaper competitors, but for those looking for handmade niche goods specifically made by their neighbors, this is the place to go.
    <br>
    We want to empower small business owners to get online, be discovered, and give them a platform for selling. Our platform will also give potential customers a simple and cohesive experience that allows an easy flow from search to purchase.
    
</p>

<h2>Users</h2>
<p>
Our platform’s primary users are urbanites looking to support businesses they believe in. These users are not looking for the cheapest item they can find, but for high quality handmade items made within the community they live in.
</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
    We conducted research and received feedback from users that we turned into personas. One of our user personas, Kate, is a 24 year old blogger that loves to showcase her favorite products on social media. The research showed that Kate is frustrated at how difficult it is to find locally made goods. Other than searching on a map, it’s challenging to find small businesses online and she wishes their were an easy way to discover what is available around her, brick and mortar or not. Kate would like to be more active in supporting local businesses, but she would like to only have to visit one location/platform to see all of the products she is interested in.
</p>

<h2>So, what’s the problem?</h2>
<p>
    Currently, the small business finder website helps her find local businesses, but following through on a purchase is not cohesive. Kate could need a completely different payment method for one store and also a totally different shipping method for another, it’s all too confusing.

Initial Design

<img src="/assets/images/shoplocalwireframe.png" style="height: 50vh; width: 32vw; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">

<p>
This wireframe is the homepage with 2 columns and a welcome image. Users can search for specific products or explore shops.

<h2>
Insights
</h2>

<p>
    Based on the results of the usability study we found 3 areas of improvement to address:
    1.	Some users felt overwhelmed by all of the text included when exploring shops 
    2.	Users wanted a cleaner interface for finding products specifically and sometimes found the featured items distracted
    3.	Some users wanted a better navigation for discovery vs when they were searching for items so that there was less to distract them from their goal    
</p>
