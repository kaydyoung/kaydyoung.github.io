<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I've always had a passion for creating things. My childhood involved a lot of legos and cardboard castles. When I turned 10 years old my family moved to Denmark and I was exposed to a new form of design: Scandinavian minimalism. I travelled occassionally to new cities and soaked in new sights. The classic architecture in Italy, the romantic facades in France, the medieval stone structures of Prague, but I always found myself appreciating the careful and simplistic forms in Danish design. Today my inspiration manifests itself on the web.
<br><br>
  My first position as a product manager immersed me in the world of data science. I took a product in the early stages and created a cohesive platform for data discovery, AI/ML model development, training, deployment, and feedback. In addition to being a one stop shop for data scientists, we gave BI analysts a free space to create and share data visualizations with easy to follow tutorials I crafted. Diving into the world of data science was a difficult task. I was learning python for the first time, learning about enterprise data architecture, and becoming an expert in Jupyter notebooks, but these challenges excited me and drove me to succeed.
<br><br>
  My passion for learning pushed me to develop this website. I studied HTML/CSS, clickstream analytics, and SEO. After I was satisfied with my design I started a blog to document everything else I'm learning and improve my writing skills. And now, I plan to release an ecommerce website for discovering local small businesses (coming soon!)
<br><br>
  I continually strive towards improvement. I develop products I believe in by iterating continually, minimizing ruthlessly, and supporting my team wholeheartedly. If you'd like to work with me, click contact in the sidebar and reach out to me on any platform.
