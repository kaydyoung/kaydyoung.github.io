<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  I've always had a passion for creating things. My childhood involved a lot of Legos and cardboard castles. When I turned 10 years old my family moved overseas and I was exposed to a new form of design: Scandinavian minimalism. We frequently explored new cities and I happily absorbed all of the new sensory information. I loved the classical architecture of Italy, the romantic facades of France, the medieval castles of Prague, but I always found myself coming back to the careful and simplistic forms in Danish design. Today, this inspiration manifests itself on the web.
  <br></br>
  I created this website as a fun personal project, but also as an experiment in optimizing a webpage for speed without sacrificing user experience. New websites frequently place form over function and I wanted to pay homage to old school efficiency with my design.
  <br></br>
  I continually strive towards improvement. I develop products I believe in by researching carefully, iterating agilely, and supporting my team wholeheartedly. If you'd like to work with me, reach out to me on social media or via email.
