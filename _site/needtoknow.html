    <h1>Need to Know</h1>
    <h2>Local Politics: "Only What You Need to Know"</h2><br>
<img src="/assets/images/politicswindow1.png" style="height: 50vh; width: 32vw; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2), 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.19);"><br></br>

<h2>Project Background</h2>
<p>
Need To Know brings easy to digest political discussions to its customers. We recognized that many people in the country struggle to access meaningful resources on local politics so we have dedicated topic sections that break down important information about current bills proposed, candidate details, and policy debates in your community.
Need to Know wants to improve participation in local politics so that we can truly influence positive change throughout the country. What makes our site so compelling is the simple language used throughout, the “need to know” content, and an abundance of graphics so customers and quickly understand complex topics.
</p>

<h2>Users</h2>
<p>
Need to Know’s primary users are busy professionals that want to have a positive impact on their community by leveraging local politics. These users generally live in high density urban areas, but may not currently be involved in local politics.
</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<p>
We conducted research and received feedback from users that we turned into personas. One of our user personas, David, is a 27 year old software developer that is busy working and getting their masters degree online. The research showed that David is frustrated at the poor user experience local government sites have and wishes their were an easy way to find out which bills/propositions mattered and what both sides of the debate are. David would like to be more proactive in local politics, but doesn’t have time to comb through government sites and local newspapers for what information actually matters to him.
</p>

<h2>So, what’s the problem?</h2>
<p>
Currently, the Need to Know website offers helpful information, but no way to follow through with action. David knows what he wants to vote on, but not how.
</p>

Initial Design
</h2>

<img src="/assets/images/politicswireframe1.png" style="height: 50vh; width: 32vw; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1), 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">

<p>
This wireframe is the homepage design I chose to go with. It has multiple articles in a grid that can be filtered by topic at the top, sorted, and a featured article sidebar.
</p>

<h2>
Insights
</h2>

<p>
Based on the results of the usability study we found 3 areas of improvement to address:
Some users felt overwhelmed by the volume of information
Users wanted a clearer direction or path to follow rather than have to investigate topics and decide which articles to click on themselves
Some users wanted to be able to take the next step on certain articles so we need the option to take users through the voting sign up step by step and give users clear directions for getting their voices heard
</p>
