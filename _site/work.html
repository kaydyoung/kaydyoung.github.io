      <p>
        I started working in product management in 2018 and have been building up software tools ever since.
        My drive for a deep understanding behind what makes a product successful led me to study UI/UX design where I gained the skills to start developing websites in my free time.
        <br></br>
        As I observed how users were actually engaging with software, I was inspired to study system architecture and design to make these interactions run smoother.
        I wanted users to have an excellent experience through a carefully thought out interface and efficient backend design.
        <br></br>
        My drive to solve problems makes me obsessed with making products better for users, my knowledge of design thinking gives me a broad perspective on user experience,
        and my technical expertise makes me a well rounded product manager that can connect with customers, developers, and designers with ease.
        <br></br>
        Take a look at my resume and feel free to reach out if you would like to work with me.
